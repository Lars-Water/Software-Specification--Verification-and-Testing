{-
    We implemented all four properties in the order in which they appeared in exercise 3
    (namely: prop1, prop2, prop3 and prop4 down below).
    Unfortunately we were not able to find a way to print them.

    However we have implemented a way to test (not proof!) if the ordering corresponds with the one we
    found during the workshop: [prop1, prop2, prop4, prop3], with prop2 and prop 4 of equal strength.
    We have used a random int generator to generate a random number between 1 and 100,
    which is then used as input to test the properties.

    The test is run through the propertyShow function.
    The value of the generated number is printed first.
    Then all the results of applying the properties in the ordered list
    (using the order function) to this number
    And lastly, the results of applying the properties in the list with the known correct order.
    It should be noted that with this test it is not possible to check whether two properties
    of equal strength appear in the same order in the two lists,
    seeing as they give the same output for the same input number.

    We were not able to compare the properties in the two list directly,
    otherwise we could have used QuickCheck on them.
