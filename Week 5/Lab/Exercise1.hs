{-  Looking at the Mutation.hs file we are given some examples
    of functions that given a list of integers, return a list of integers
    that is mutated in some way. We have taken the same function type into account
    and come up with the following possible mutations for a list of integers.
    Each will have an example and some of these we have implemented below as well.

    1. Adding duplicates to the list                <- NOT REALLY COVERED YET
    example: [1,2,3] -> [1,1,2,2,3,3]
    2. Removing all elements from the list          <- NOT YET COVERED
    example: [1,2,3] -> []
    3. Shuffle  the list                            <- NOT YET COVERED
    example: [1,2,3] -> [2,3,1]
    5. Splitting the list into sublists             <- NOT YET COVERED
    example: [1,2,3] -> [[1],[2],[3]]
    6. Wrap the original list into a new list       <- NOT YET COVERED
    example: [1,2,3] -> [[1,2,3]]
