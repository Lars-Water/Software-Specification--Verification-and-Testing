    The strength of a given set of properties i.e. the percentage of mutants they kill, can be defined as [1 - (n_survivors / n_mutants) * 100%].

    The percentage of killed mutants can be determined from the percentage of survived mutants. The percentage of survivors will be calculated by
    utilizing the 'countSurvivors' function as defined in Exercise2, after which the number of survivors is divided by the number of mutants.

    Consequently, the remaining percentage of mutants would be the number of mutants killed.

    Although simple, this approach appears to cover what is expected.
