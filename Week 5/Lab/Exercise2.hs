-- This is how the function works:
-- Type definition of the function: mutator -> number of mutants -> list of properties -> function to test (multiplicationtable) -> suriving mutants
-- 1. Generate list of inputs for the function up till the number of mutants and mutate these
-- 2. For each of these mutants we use the mutate' function to see if it satisfies the properties
-- 3. If it does, we add it to the list of surviving mutants

    results <- mapM (\x -> survived mutator props func x) inputs
    return $ toInteger $ length $ filter (==True) results

-- This helper function will return True if the mutant satisfies all the properties.
-- Example: the mutator addElements would work as follows
-- 1. We mutate the input: [1,2,3] -> [1,2,3,4]
-- 2. We check if the mutated input satisfies the properties: [1,2,3,4] -> [prop_tenElements, prop_linear] -> [True, False]
-- 3. If all the properties are satisfied, we return True, else False: [True, False] -> False
