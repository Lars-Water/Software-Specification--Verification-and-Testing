    To calculate the minimal property susbset
    we will first create the powerset of (list of) properties
    to get all the possible combinations of properties.
    Then we will count the number of survivors for each combination
    and determine the which combinations lead to the minimum amount of survivors.
    I if there is only, this is the minimal property subset.
    If there are multiple combinations with the minimum
    we select the subset with the smallest number of properties.
    For example, if [prop1, prop2] has the same amount of survivors as [prop1, prop2, prop3]
    then the subset containing prop1 and prop2 is the minimal property set.
    If there are multiple subsets with the same amount of properties
    (and with the minimum amount of survivors), we return them both.
