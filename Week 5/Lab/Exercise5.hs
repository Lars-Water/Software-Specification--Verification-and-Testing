    To calculate the conjectures
    we will first create the powerset of (list of) properties
    to get all the possible combinations of properties.
    Then we will count the number of survivors for each combination
    and determine based on the survivors which conjectures can be made.
    Example:
    Properties: [1,2,3]
    Combinations: [[1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]]
    Survivors: [1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
    Some example conjectures: 1 ==> 2, 3 ==> 1, [1,3] == [2,3]
    Do note that this function will not be able to check for disjunctions.
    So both property 1 and 2 might have 1 survivor and we will state them as equivalent,
    but the survivor might be different making them disjoint

    Conjectures equivalence:
        The approach to calculating equivalence conjectures starts with defining the powerset of the list of properties. Subsequently,
        mutation tests are performed on every subset in this powerset. Specification of the mutants that were killed should be returned
        from these mutation tests. Consequently, equivalence conjectures can be determined through comparison of the killed mutants where
        an equal return value implies equivalence.
    Conjecture implication:
