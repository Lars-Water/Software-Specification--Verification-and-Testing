    Conjectures equivalence:
        The approach to calculating equivalence conjectures starts with defining the powerset of the list of properties. Subsequently,
        mutation tests are performed on every subset in this powerset. Specification of the mutants that were killed should be returned
        from these mutation tests. Consequently, equivalence conjectures can be determined through comparison of the killed mutants where
        an equal return value implies equivalence.
    Conjecture implication:
        ...
