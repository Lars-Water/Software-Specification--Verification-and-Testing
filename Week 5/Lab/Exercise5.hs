    To calculate the conjectures we will first create the powerset of (list of) properties to get all the possible combinations of properties.
    For every subset of properties, a list is returned where the elements represent the state of the mutant (Survived=True & Killed=False).
    Mutation tests are performed on every subset in this powerset. Through utilization of these mutation tests and the helper functions
    'equivalence' and 'implication', the conjectures are determined for every subset of properties.

    Conjectures equivalence:
        Specification of the mutants that were killed should be returned from the mutation tests. Consequently, equivalence conjectures
        can be determined through comparison of the killed mutants where the same mutants killed implies equivalence.
        The 'equivalence' helper function maps the list of mutation tests for every property subset to the remaining mutation tests of property
        subsets. If the compared mutations tests portrayed equal results, the compared property subsets are added as an equivalence pair to the returned list.
        The returned list contains all property subset pairs with equivalence conjecture.
    Conjecture implication:
        Specification of the mutant states should be returned from the mutation tests. Consequently, implication conjectures
        can be determined through comparison of the killed mutants from a property subset where AT LEAST the same mutants killed in the
        other property subset implies implication.
        The 'implication' helper function maps the list of mutation tests for every property subset to the remaining mutation tests of property subsets.
        If AT LEAST all mutants killed in the first test of the compared mutations tests were also killed in the second test, the compared property subsets
        are added as an implication pair to the returned list.
        The returned list contains all property subset pairs with implication conjecture.

    *The example below was ran to check the funcitonality of the functions:
    Properties: [1,2]
    Combinations: [[1,2], [1], [2], []]]
    Survivors:
        [1,2] - [False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False]
        [1]   - [False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False]
        [2]   - [False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False]
        []    - [True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True,True]
    Resulting conjectures were: [1] == [1,2], [2] ==> [1,2], [2] ==> [1]

    The results from the above example run implies that the implementation for conjectures was done correctly.
    The equivalence conjectures holds for property subset 1 and 2 and property subset 1. Both these subsets killed the same mutants.
    The implication conjecture holds for property subset 2 to property subset 1 and 2 and for property subset 2 to property subset 1.
    The set of killed mutants from property subset 2 is a subset of killed mutants for both property subset 1 and property subset 1 and 2.

    Properties index:
        Property 1: Output list has exactly 10 elements
        Property 2: First number is the input
        Property 3: The sum of the output is the input times the 10th triangle number
        Property 4: The difference between consecutive elements is the input
        Property 5: Any element modulo the input is zero
