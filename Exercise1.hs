    Every run with a sample size of 10000 randomly generated numbers returns an occurrence of roughly
    2500 numbers in every quartile. These results imply that the probs function simulates a uniformly
    distributed random number generator. We therefore can assume that Curry was right about his
    statement.

    Furthermore, the occurrence count shows that the total number of occurrences sum up to 10,000, the
    total sample size. This can also be seen in our test were we show the original length of the list
    and the sum of each of the quartiles. For this exercise we have chosen to stick with the sample size
    of 10000, but we have also tested the function with a sample size of 1000 and 5000 to which we saw
    similar results.

    These results can be derrived from the main function.
