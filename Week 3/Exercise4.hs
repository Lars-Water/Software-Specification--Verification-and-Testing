{-  Generator for Form
    Why did we choose this generator and our understanding of how it works:
    We went with this generator because it provided a clear overview of how the generator
    distinguishes between props and operands (neg, conj, disj, impl, equiv). It also provides
    great compatibility with the quickCheck since quickCheck can simply pick any Integer upon which
    the generator will create a form based on that. This way we can efficiently check for a lot of forms
    given a certain property at.

{-  This helper is being called in our generator
    in order to optimize generation speed when quickCheck
    is asked to choose an n value.

formGenerator' n | n > 15 = formGenerator' (div2 n) -- to prevent the chosen n to be too big we call the div2 function to halve it for efficiency

-- 2. Given a formula f, the outcome of cnf f should be an actual cnf.

-- This helper function checks if a given form is a cnf based on exhaustive pattern matching.
-- There could be edge cases that are missing in this function, thus unfortunately we cannot
-- guarantee the full-proofness of this function.

{-  In the main function we run quickCheck on our properties.
    Above we have defined our properties that a cnf function should satisfy
    should it work. Our formGenerator provides a great way of testing these
    properties for a lot of different forms. Unfortunately our CNF function
    is not yet full-proof. Given a full-proof CNF function we would expect that
    the following tests would pass generated forms, since each CNF should be
    logical equivalent to it's non CNF formula and it should follow the rules
    to be a CNF.
