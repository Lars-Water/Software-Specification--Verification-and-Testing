{-  In this file we once again use our formGenerator from exercise 4 to test the property of Clause
    transformation. We state that if a fomrula is a CNF it can be converted into a Clause list, in which
    all unique props in the clause list should be the same as the unconverted formula. We check this
    by generating a random formula filtered on CNF's. The property should then hold for all CNF's.
    Which as we can see is indeed the case. This automatic testing is done in the main function.
