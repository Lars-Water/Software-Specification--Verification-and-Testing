{-
    ROT13 is a simple algorithm that changes every character in a string to the character 13 places further from it
    in the alphabet. If the 13 range jump is further than the character z, the algorithm continues at the start of
    the alphabet again. This is for both capital and non-capital alphabet characters.

    For example, the string "Hello World" would be encoded as "Uryyb Jbeyq" using ROT13.
    In our our implementation we check for both upper and lower case letters and only encode letters.
    All other characters are left as they are. For example, the string "Hello World!" would be encoded as "Uryyb Jbeyq!".
    If a letter goes beyond the end of the alphabet, it wraps around to the start of the alphabet.

    We check our function with two properties:
    1. We make sure that the length of the encoded string is the same as the length of the original string.
    2. We make sure that if the original string is a non-alphabet character string, the encoded string is the same as the original string.

        * Our second property is quite strong since we are very specific we only allow non-alphabet characters string, this
        results in QuickCheck not being able to find enough counter examples before giving up.
