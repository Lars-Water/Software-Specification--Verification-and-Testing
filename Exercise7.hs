{-
    In the main function we have given a list of working iban numbers and non valid iban numbers.
    source: https://www.iban.com/structure
    on which we have all tested the iban function (which could be transformed to a property).
    The results show that all the iban numbers are valid and all the non valid iban numbers are invalid.

    We could automate this process by transforming the iban function into a property and then use quickCheck to test it.
    Howwever since the iban constraint on the string is rather specific we feel like quickCheck would not be able to generate
    enough random strings to test the property before giving up.
