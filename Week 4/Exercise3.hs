-- This is a Breadth-first Search function, used to recursively traverse through an IOLTS. It gets a list of
-- all transitions of the model and a queue of States and their corresponding Traces as parameters and returns
-- a list of all Traces in the model. It starts off by retrieving all of the States that are directly linked
-- to the first State in the queue. After that, the function returns the Trace of the first State in the queue,
-- appended to the return value of the bfs function which gets recursively called, wherein the original queue's
-- first element gets removed and the retrieved States earlier on in the function get appended to the queue,
-- along with their Traces
