{-  4.C Consider the relation R = {(x, y) | x = y(mod n)}, where (mod n) is the modulo function in modular arithmetic and n > 0.
    Discuss whether (and when) R is serial. How can you test whether R is serial? How can you prove that R is serial?
    Answer: If we look at mod we know that if n is > y then y mod n will result in y. Thus if we want to make sure given a domain:
    [1,2,3] that the relation is serial we need to make sure that the relation is [(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)]. We can ensure this by making sure
    that n is greater or equal than the maximum element in the domain. We can then surely say that each x has a relation in the relational set
    with y. However when n becomes smaller than the maximum element (let's say we choose n = 2) we will end up with a relational set such as [(1,1), (2,2) (1,3)]
    As we can see this time the relational set is not serial anymore.
    So we can test this by defining a property that makes sure n is greater or equal to the maximum element of the domain
